**Trackrrr** allows you to configure your notifications in multiple ways:

- Selectively enable/disable different types of notifications
- Customize the notification text for more discrete (or fun!) notifications

On Android, **Trackrrr** leverages Android's native functionality to configure notification channels, which allows you to selectively enable or disable some or all notifications based on type.

There are 3 types of notifications you can enable/disable:

- **Period past reminders**: These are triggered when your period is estimated to have started. They will have a "Log now"  button allowing you to start your current period.
- **Upcoming period reminders**: Provided **Trackrrr** has enough data to calculate your upcoming period, 7 days before your period is projected to start, you should receive a notification reminding you.
- **Period end date verification**: On the projected end date of your period, you will be prompted to confirm the period end date. If you ignore this notification, nothing happens, it will use the projected end date (same day you receive the notification). You can action the notification to change this date.

To enable or disable one of these types of notifications, you can visit **Trackrrr**'s notification settings in your Android settings. A shortcut has been added to **Trackrrr**:

- Tap the cog at the top right
- Tap Notifications

On top of customizing the notifications natively via Android, **Trackrrr** has the ability for you to customize the notification text for each of the above types of notifications. You can access this by going to the settings screen by tapping the cog at the top right, then tapping Notification text.

This feature will allow you to customize the text to make it more discrete. We've all gotten awkward notifications from our current period trackers, and maybe others saw these messages and it left you feeling uncomfortable. When you customize the notifications, the title says "Reminder" and the notification body says whatever you put. You can use this to make your notifications more discrete, or more fun! You can also delete the text if you'd like to revert back to the default notifications.
