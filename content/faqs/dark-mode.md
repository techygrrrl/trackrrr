Yes, dark mode is supported. By default, **Trackrrr** uses your system's configuration, but if you prefer one of the appearance modes more than another, you can override this in the **Trackrrr** settings to always use that theme. Tap the cog at the top right and tap Theme, and choose between System, Light and Night themes.
