I've really enjoyed building **Trackrrr** on my [Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/techygrrrl) so I will probably build an iOS version. That said, there are no immediate plans to do so. I'd like to see how the Android app does. I work full-time and this is a labour of love and I can only work on **Trackrrr** in my off time. That said, I built **Trackrrr** for Android in about 10 streams, so I see it being a pretty strong possibility, and a great opportunity to learn a new framework like Swift UI!
