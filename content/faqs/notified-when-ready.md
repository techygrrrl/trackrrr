There are a few ways you can stay in the loop with the development of the app. 

**Trackrrr** is being built by [techygrrrl](https://twitch.tv/techygrrrl) (me) with feedback from the community on Twitch. You can always join in on the conversation there.

You can also join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/UDBr9v6mjA) server to chat.

Occasionally I post to my [blog](https://blog.techygrrrl.stream). When something important happens with **Trackrrr**, I will be posting updates there. The blog has an [RSS feed](https://blog.techygrrrl.stream/rss.xml) you can subscribe to in your favourite RSS reader to get notified. Blog posts are also posted to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/UDBr9v6mjA) server.
