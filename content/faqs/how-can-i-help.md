Firstly, thank you for wanting to help out with the project! This means a lot! 🙏 

There are 2 main ways you can help out:

1. **Translating the app in your language** – If you speak another language, please join the [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/ETAZEOvdg4) project to help translate. There's approximately 80 terms that need to be translated. There's a document that links to screenshots of the app in an effort to add some context. There are some pre-selected languages. You can help as little or as much as you like, though full translations are required in order for it to be published to the app. I will also be verifying the translations to prevent abuse. **I especially need help from people who have or used to have periods as they will be most familiar with colloquialisms used to talk about periods**. Still, if you have never menstruated but would like to help, human translations are still much better than machine translations or no translations at all, so your help is appreciated.
2. **Beta testing the app** – When the app is ready (soon 🤞) I will need help beta testing before going into the store. For this task, **I'd like all beta testers to be people who have periods**. Translators will also be invited to join in on the beta testing so they can see their strings in context (if they don't see them on stream).
